The Control Panel in Microsoft Windows enables a user to change various computer hardware and software features. Settings for the mouse, display, sound, network, and keyboard represent a few examples of what may be modified in the Control Panel.

## Sections of the Windows Control Panel

1. **System and Security** - A section to check your computer's status, backup and restore, and others.
2. **Network and Internet** - View network status.
3. **Hardware and Sound** - View which devices are on your computer and add devices.
4. **Programs** - Uninstall programs.
5. **User Accounts** - Change user accessibility.
6. **Appearance and Personalization** - Change desktop options, like fonts and screen readers.
7. **Clock and Region** - Change date and time.
8. **Ease of access** - Optimize your display settings.

## How to Access the Control Panel?

Think of Control Panel as the place to go in Windows if you want to change something about how it looks or works. In recent versions of Windows, Control Panel resides in the Windows System folder or category in the Apps listing. In other versions, open the Start menu and then choose Control Panel, or Start > Settings > Control Panel.

## How to Use the Control Panel?

The Control Panel itself is really just a collection of shortcuts to individual components called Control Panel applets. Therefore, to use Control Panel really means to use an individual applet to change some part of how Windows works.

If you're looking for a way to access the areas of Control Panel directly, without first going through the program, see our List of Control Panel Commands in Windows for the commands that start each applet. Since some applets are shortcuts to files with the CPL file extension, you can point directly to the CPL file to open that component.

## How to Open Control Panel

The Control Panel in Windows is a collection of applets, sort of like tiny programs, that can be used to configure various aspects of the operating system.

For example, one applet in Control Panel lets you configure the mouse pointer size (among other things), while another allows you to adjust all the sound-related settings.

Other applets can be used to change network settings, set up storage space, manage display settings, and much more. You can see what they all do in our list of Control Panel applets.

So, before you can make any of these changes to Windows, you'll need to open the Control Panel. Fortunately, it's super easy to doâ€”at least in most versions of Windows.
